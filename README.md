# Summer-Internships
A list of national and international summer internships for undergrads.

Starting November the applications will open for a lot of national and international summer programs.
I've tried to list down the ones I could think of and will keep them updating. Most of them are computer science internships but may have projects for other fields as well.
 While most accept third years , some programs accept second years as well. 
 Another important thing to note is that many of these applications need a lot of information and can take up quite some time so keep in mind the deadlines and plan accordingly.

There is also Eklavya, the IIT Bombay internship program for which I couldn't find a working link.
For the winter, IIT Kharagpur may organise 
IIT Kharagpur Winter of Code that has a lot of good projects and can be a good practice for GSoC.
For Girls, there's Rails Girls Summer of Code and OutReachy.
All the best!
